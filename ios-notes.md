To record video when you need only minimal control over format, use the UIKit framework (UIImagePickerController). The UIImagePickerController class manages customizable, system-supplied user interfaces for taking pictures and movies on supported devices, and for choosing saved images and movies for use in your app.

 "Implicit animations occur automatically in response to setting a new value for an animatable layer property. Core Animation assumes full responsibility for running the animation, at frame rate, in a separate thread, freeing your application to handle other events."

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4979192/ios-using-uiviews-drawrect-vs-its-layers-delagate-drawlayerincontext "Always use drawRect:, and never use a UIView as the drawing delegate for any CALayer." and "While the use of drawRect is common, it's a practice that has been discouraged since at least 2002/2003, IIRC"

https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1708/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010245 Q:  What can I do to improve my image drawing performance (CGContextDrawImage, UIImage/-drawInRect:, etc)?
  * Every UIView is backed with a CALayer and images as layer contents remain in memory as long as the CALayer stays in the hierarchy.
  * One way to do it would be applying a rotation transform to the Current Transform Matrix (CGContextRotateCTM) and redrawing the image (CGContextDrawImage) in the UIView's -drawRect: method at every animation step. However, a much more efficient way is to set the image as the contents property of the backing CALayer, and then animate the layer's transform property to achieve the rotating animation.
  * If you can, adjust your resource art so that the image size (in pixels) is the same as its displayed size (in pixels), meaning you would provide different image sets for iPhone/iPod touch (image.png), iPhone 4 (image@2x.png), and iPad (image-iPad.png). Further, you could cache the images yourself by drawing into a bitmap context and caching the image you create from the context.

  The view controller references its view from its _view instance variable.
  The view doesn't store its frame directly. It just returns its layer's `frame'.
  The view references its layer from its _layer instance variable.
  The layer doesn't store the frame either. It computes its frame from its bounds, position, anchorPoint, and transform. The size is part of bounds.
  The layer doesn't store its bounds directly in an instance variable. Instead, its layer instance variable references an instance of a private C++ class, CA::Layer. The member layout of this class is undocumented.

force a UIView to re-render is [myView setNeedsDisplay]  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1503761/what-is-the-most-robust-way-to-force-a-uiview-to-redraw

the key in CALayer: (void)addAnimation:(CAAnimation *)anim forKey:(NSString *)key; is not necessarily the same as the one in CAPropertyAnimation: (id)animationWithKeyPath:(NSString *)path -- though if the latter is nil, it gets filled in if you pass it to the former

If you want animated properties to stick when the animation ends, you have to either
    animation.removedOnCompletion = NO;
    animation.fillMode = kCAFillModeForwards;
or have the presentation layer send the new values into the model layer (or model itself) in the setter.

The CAAnimation and CALayer classes are key-value coding compliant container classes, which means that you can set values for arbitrary keys. http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Key-ValueCodingExtensions/Key-ValueCodingExtensions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004514-CH12-SW2

bounds vs. frame in layers: Layers have an implicit frame that is a function of the position, bounds, anchorPoint, and transform properties. Setting a new frame rectangle changes the layer's position and bounds properties appropriately, but the frame itself is not stored. When a new frame rectangle is specified the bounds origin is undisturbed, while the bounds size is set to the size of the frame. The layer's position is set to the proper location relative to the anchor point. When you get the frame property value, it is calculated relative to the position, bounds, and anchorPoint properties.

## Core Graphics / Quartz 2D

https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/Introduction/Introduction.html
  "Quartz 2D provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity regardless of display or printing device. Quartz 2D is resolution- and device-independent; you donâ€™t need to think about the final destination when you use the Quartz 2D application programming interface (API) for drawing. The Quartz 2D API is easy to use and provides access to powerful features such as transparency layers, path-based drawing, offscreen rendering, advanced color management, anti-aliased rendering, and PDF document creation, display, and parsing. The Quartz 2D API is part of the Core Graphics framework, so you may see Quartz referred to as Core Graphics or, simply, CG."

"The fundamental tool used to create paths is the BÃ©zier curve... An application specifies the BÃ©zier curves as a series of short curve segments. In the most common case, there are four points in user space that make up each segment. The curve is set up so that, once the numbers are crunched, the path passes through the first point and the last point. The curve is pulled away from a straight line by the two other points in a way that is both mathematically elegant and ultimately intuitive." http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/09/28/quartz.html?page=2

Cocos2D works with points, not pixels. On Retina display devices, 1 point = 2 pixels, so 1136Ã—640 pixels = 568Ã—320 points. This is quite handy, because if you use points in your game, your coordinates can be the same for both retina and non-retina displays!
the position is relative to the center of the sprite you are adding
Cocos2D â€“ itâ€™s smart enough to substitute the high resolution graphics when youâ€™re running on a Retina display! Just put in some artwork that is double the size and add an -hd extension. This is similar to the @2x behavior that UIKit supports.

http://benbritten.com/2008/11/06/openal-sound-on-the-iphone/ :
    the quickest (and easiest) way to make the iPhone spit out some sound is to use the audio system services:

    NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"soundEffect1" ofType:@"caf"];
    NSURL * afUrl = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path];
    UInt32 soundID;
    AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)afUrl,&soundID);
    AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (soundID);

    this works well for making your interface buttons click and simple UI interaction stuff. However, it is absolutely shite for anything more complicated than that (think: a game)... For better control of the sound, you will require either openAL or audioUnits or the audioQueue.

  Use the Media Player framework to play songs, audio books, or audio podcasts from a userâ€™s iPod library. For details, see Media Player Framework Reference, iPod Library Access Programming Guide, and the AddMusic sample code project.
  Use the AV Foundation framework to play and record audio using a simple Objective-C interface. For details, see AV Foundation Framework Reference and the avTouch sample code project.
  Use the Audio Toolbox framework to play audio with synchronization capabilities, access packets of incoming audio, parse audio streams, convert audio formats, and record audio with access to individual packets. For details, see Audio Toolbox Framework Reference and the SpeakHere sample code project.
  Use the Audio Unit framework to connect to and use audio processing plug-ins. For details, see Audio Unit Hosting Guide for iOS.
  Use the OpenAL framework to provide positional audio playback in games and other applications. iOS supports OpenAL 1.1. For information on OpenAL, see the OpenAL website, OpenAL FAQ for iPhone OS, and the oalTouch sample code project.

  The open-sourced OpenAL audio API, available in iOS in the OpenAL framework, provides an interface optimized for positioning sounds in a stereo field during playback. Playing, positioning, and moving sounds works just as it does on other platforms. OpenAL also lets you mix sounds. OpenAL uses the I/O unit for playback, resulting in the lowest latency.
  For all of these reasons, OpenAL is your best choice for playing sounds in game applications on iOS-based devices. However, OpenAL is also a good choice for general iOS application audio playback needs.

NSLog output is hidden - http://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/where-is-nslog-output-for-ocunit-tests/

"did not finish" - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12308297/some-of-my-unit-tests-tests-are-not-finishing-in-xcode-4-4 :
